# Infinite Monkeys

Inifinite Monkeys is 2D action-roguelike game where the player traverses rooms defeating enemies and collecting items in order to escape. It is built in the Unity game engine with C# programming language.

Imagine monkeys as test subjects in a massive science facility, traversing hazardous platforms and solving puzzles. The theme centers around the Infinite Monkey Theorem of keep trying over and over, and at some point in time, sucess will be found. This idea is a fundamental aspect of roguelike games in general, and we wanted to pay homage to that. With a roguelike structure, the levels are procedurally generated. This affects elements such as landscape and enemy placement, allowing for a unique play experience every time.

## Mechanics

The central theme of the game is uniqueness. A roguelike game inherently has the ability to provide fresh experiences for its players, and that was a strong factor in development. Here's some things to expect when enjoying the game:

  1. **Randomly generated levels:** Each run should provide a new experience for the player, whether that's a result of level layout, enemy encounters, or weapon/item pickups.
  2. **Platforming:** While the main objective of the game is to currently get to the end of the level, platforming plays a big part of maneuverability, no only horizontally but also vertically. There is also obstacles to watch out for, so don't go too fast!
  3. **Combat:** The player will encounter a number of different enemies with their own movement and attacks, which will require the player to think about the best way to handle each situation.

## Conclusion

Overall the team is overall happy with the current state of the project. There are many ideas that wanted to be implemented but were cut due to time, yet may see the light of day in a future version. Thanks for checking it out!
