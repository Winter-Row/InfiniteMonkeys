# InfiniteMonkeys
Roguelike Fighting/Puzzle Platformer Game

The game will be a 2D action roguelike where the player will traverse rooms defeating enemies and collecting items in order to escape each section until reaching the end. Because this is a roguelike, the levels will be procedurally generated, affecting elements such as landscape and enemy placement, allowing for a unique play experience every time. Once the player loses, they will have to completely start over from the beginning. The game will combine 2D combat with platforming elements. The setting of the game involves monkeys as test subjects in a massive science facility, traversing hazardous platforms and solving puzzles. The theme of the game centers around the Infinite Monkey Theorem (keep trying over and over, and at some point in time, it will work), which embodies the theme of a roguelike game. The graphics are planned to be mostly 2D, though we may incorporate elements of 3D graphics.

We will use the Unity software engine and Unity Editor, with the C# language for scripts.
